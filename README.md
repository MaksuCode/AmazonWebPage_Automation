# AmazonWebPage_Automation

Amazon web page automation with BDD approach


****This is my personal Amazon Web Page Automation project using Selenium Web driver.***

-Used WebDriver Factory Patterm
-Used Junit
-Used Cucumber and Gherkin syntax
-Tried to write according to POM (Page Objec Model)
-Class names such as User.class and Product.class are used for a better undestanding for the non-tecnical teammates such as business analysists etc.
