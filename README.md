Amazzn web page automation with BDD approach

****This is my personal Amazon Web Page Automation project using Selenium Web driver.***

-Used Cucumber and Gherkin syntax
-Tried to write according to POM (Page Objec Model)
-User.class and Product.class are used for a better undestanding for the non-tecnical team mates such as business analysists etc.
